PureScents is a one-page landing page that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project on my own as a way to practice and improve my front-end development skills. 
The page has a clean and modern design with interactive elements powered by JavaScript, but it is not fully responsive yet. The technologies used in this project include HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity.
